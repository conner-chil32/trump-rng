## A Truly ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ AMERICAN ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ Random Number Generator

Tired of all the unequal and non-reciprocal random number generators out there? Well here is a new option to replace all of those existing terrible, inefficent and ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ UNAMERICAN ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ generators out there.<br>

We only use the best seeds to generate our numbers. Which are the best numbers that have ever been generated, no one else has ever come up with a better algorithm to generate random numbers. <br>

Believe me. <br>

## (NO SATIRE) What this package actually does

This package randomly picks from a list of trump's recently released "reciprocal" tariffs and outputs the result as a number.<br>
